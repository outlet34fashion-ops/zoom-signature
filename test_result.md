# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

Both are WebSocket real-time and timezone issues that need immediate fixing."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CONCLUSION: Automatic printing is NOT working because the host service (host_print_service.py) is not running on the host Mac. The backend is working perfectly and will print automatically once the host service is started. EXACT SOLUTION: 1) Copy /app/host_print_service.py to Mac, 2) Run 'pip3 install flask requests', 3) Run 'python3 host_print_service.py', 4) Service starts on localhost:9876, 5) Automatic printing works immediately."

Even though customer TEST001 is properly authenticated (localStorage shows 'TEST001', API calls /api/customers/check/TEST001 work), the frontend displays customer number as '10299' in header, profile, chat messages, and order messages. Root cause: currentCustomer state is not properly populated with actual customer data from API response. Chat messages show 'Chat 10299 I message' instead of 'Chat TEST001 I message'. Order messages show 'Bestellung 10299 I ...' instead of 'Bestellung TEST001 I ...'. The checkCustomerStatus function (line 268-296) retrieves correct data but currentCustomer state is not being set properly. This explains user reports - orders DO appear in chat but with wrong customer number format."

        comment: "FRONTEND FIX IMPLEMENTED: Fixed customer number resolution in both placeOrder (line 676) and sendMessage (line 630) functions. Now uses: currentCustomer?.customer_number || localStorage.getItem('customerNumber') || '10299'. This ensures correct customer number is used from localStorage when currentCustomer state is not yet populated. Also implemented bold formatting for 'Bestellung' using **Bestellung** markdown syntax and added formatMessage() helper function to convert **text** to <strong>text</strong> in chat display. Changes: 1) Correct customer number resolution, 2) Bold 'Bestellung' formatting, 3) Chat message rendering with formatMessage()."

Tested complete flow: 1) Customer registration (TEST2025) - SUCCESS, 2) Admin activation via dashboard - SUCCESS (customer shows as 'Aktiv'), 3) Customer login attempt - FAILED (authentication not working despite activation). Root cause: Customer authentication flow is broken - even activated customers cannot login to access order functionality. This prevents testing of the actual order-to-chat fixes. The frontend fixes for customer number resolution (lines 688, 642) and bold formatting (formatMessage function) appear correctly implemented in code, but cannot be verified due to authentication blocking access to authenticated customer features.

However, order messages in chat still show 'Bestellung 10299' instead of 'Bestellung TEST3025', indicating the customer number resolution fix in placeOrder function (line 747) is not working correctly. The localStorage fallback mechanism appears to not be functioning as expected. Orders DO appear in chat (resolving user's main concern), but with incorrect customer number. This is a display issue rather than a functional failure. Bold formatting for 'Bestellung' needs verification but cannot be confirmed due to message format issues."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL FRONTEND CHAT TESTING COMPLETED - MIXED RESULTS: Comprehensive testing of https://livestream-labels.preview.emergentagent.com reveals TWO CRITICAL PROBLEMS: 1) ✅ TIMEZONE BUG STATUS: Chat messages currently show CORRECT German time (19:08:37, 19:08:36, 19:08:35) matching actual German time 19:09:28. NO 2-hour difference detected during testing. This issue may be intermittent or already resolved. 2) ❌ WEBSOCKET REAL-TIME UPDATES FAILING: CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED - sent 3 test messages (REALTIME TEST 1, 2, 3) but ZERO messages appeared in chat in real-time. WebSocket connects successfully (console shows WebSocket connected) but real-time message display is broken. Messages are sent to backend but frontend does NOT update immediately. User must reload page to see new messages. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX of WebSocket message handling in frontend."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL LIVEKIT STREAMING FAILURE: Comprehensive testing confirms LiveKit streaming is NOT working. Key findings: 1) ❌ MISSING UI: The '🔴 LIVE gehen - Professional' button is completely missing from admin dashboard, 2) ❌ NO LIVEKIT INTERFACE: Zero LiveKit components found in DOM (no video elements, streaming interface, or connection status), 3) ❌ BACKEND DISCONNECT: While LiveKit backend APIs exist, they're not connected to frontend UI, 4) ❌ ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM: Found YouTube Live integration instead of LiveKit, 5) ❌ NO CUSTOMER VIEW: No LiveKit viewer interface for customers. CONCLUSION: Despite backend implementation, frontend LiveKit integration is completely missing. This is the core feature of the app and requires immediate implementation of the LiveKit UI components and admin streaming controls."
