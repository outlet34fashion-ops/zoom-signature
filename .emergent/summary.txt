This trajectory details the AI engineer's work on a Live Shopping App, iteratively addressing user requests and critical bugs. Initially, significant effort was dedicated to fixing the , which suffered from unresponsive buttons, incorrect modal invocation, z-index conflicts, and loading state issues. The engineer meticulously debugged UI events, API payloads, and React state management across multiple attempts. Subsequent work involved implementing a new 'Material Properties' modal, reordering product input fields with validation, and refining the mobile product catalog header. A notable back-and-forth occurred regarding the placement of logout functionality and branding elements. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of horizontal category tabs and the *start* of drag-and-drop sorting for categories in the admin interface. The process highlights a systematic approach to debugging and feature development, though some issues required multiple iterations due to subtle interaction bugs and miscommunications.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App is a platform for live streaming, chat, and product ordering, featuring a modern UI and automated Zebra label printing. It includes migration to Daily.co, branding updates, and dynamic navigation. Product management requires a WhatsApp-style grid, detailed product views, and admin features for media uploads, price changes, and product creation with auto-generated article numbers. Categories need to support a hierarchical structure (main/subcategories) with product counts. Product details require categorized material, color, and size selections. Customer profiles are to be extended with specific fields and a status.

Explicit requests and implemented features in this trajectory include:
- A dedicated  for managing main and subcategories via a new button.
- A new Material Properties modal, optional for product creation, with categories like soft, elegant, robust, knit/stretch, and glossy.
- Reordering of product input fields in the create form: Price and Stock (top), Sizes Overview (mandatory), Color Chart (mandatory), Material Overview (optional), Material Properties (mandatory).
- Moving 'Logout' functionality into a profile picture dropdown menu for both admin and customer, removing standalone logout buttons.
- Removing OUTLET34 text and logo from the top bar (later reversed to re-include profile picture/logout, but keep branding removed).
- Mobile optimization for the product catalog header: smaller OUTLET34 Produktkatalog title, Meine Bestellung and a close 'X' button for better mobile overview.
- Reordering product display in the catalog for customers: Neue Artikel (New Products) first, then Bestseller.
- Implementing horizontal, scrollable category tabs (Oberteile, Hosen&Jeans, Kleider&Röcke, Jacken Mäntel, Accessoires) in the catalog.
- Implementing sortability for all main and subcategories in the admin area, and adding images to articles.

- :
    - **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, defines API endpoints and MongoDB models. Contains product and category related models and endpoints.
    - **Changes Made**: Extended  and  models to include the  field (List[str]). Backend API  was verified to be working correctly.
- :
    - **Importance**: Central React component, handles state, UI logic, and API calls.
    - **Changes Made**: Significant refactoring for  integration and bug fixes. Integrated . Updated  state with . Reordered product input fields and updated validation logic. Implemented profile picture dropdowns for logout (customer/admin) and later re-added them after a user-requested removal/reversal.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the requested category sorting functionality in the admin area. Specifically, the task involves adding drag-and-drop capabilities to the category lists within the . The engineer had just started to implement the necessary functions for sorting. This includes identifying the correct UI elements in  to attach drag-and-drop handlers and modify their display, after adding a  state variable to manage this feature. The last action was an attempt to add drag-and-drop functionality to the category lists, but the precise location or method was being refined. The user expects all main and subcategories to be sortable within the admin interface.
