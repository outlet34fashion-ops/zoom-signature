The AI engineer successfully transformed a live shopping application by iteratively implementing several key features based on user requests. This included expanding material selection, creating comprehensive categorized modals for colors, materials, and sizes, adding product counts to categories, and integrating a WhatsApp-style camera for media uploads. Challenges involved persistent JSX parsing errors during frontend modal integration, which were eventually resolved through systematic debugging. The engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, utilizing backend testing and subsequent frontend verification (though sometimes interrupted by session issues or requiring manual user verification). A recurring ESLint warning ('setCustomerId' not defined) was present but not explicitly addressed. Key initial pending tasks, such as the desktop split-screen layout, Mac auto-printer files, and specific customer profile frontend display issues, remain unaddressed. The overall trajectory shows significant progress in expanding core product management and media functionalities.

The Live Shopping App aims to provide a platform for live streaming, chat, and product ordering, featuring a modern UI and automatic Zebra label printing. The initial focus was on replacing an unstable LiveKit streaming solution with a low-latency, reliable Daily.co integration, along with branding updates (new logos) and dynamic header navigation (login/logout buttons, header visibility based on authentication).

Subsequent detailed requirements emerged:
1.  **Product Catalog**: Implement a WhatsApp-style grid/gallery with product images, article number, name, price. Clicking a product should open a detail view with a larger photo, description, and an order field (quantity + Add to Order button).
2.  **Admin Features**: Enable new image/video uploads with drag & drop and sortable order. Allow price changes and product creation with automatic article number generation (starting from 1 if not manually entered). Categories should be manageable and support a hierarchical structure (main categories mandatory, subcategories optional for products). Users also requested to list the quantity of items in categories and a WhatsApp-style direct camera capture for media.
3.  **Customer Features**: Provide a My Order overview, a Recently Viewed section, and a Favorite function with a heart symbol for quick access.
4.  **Product Details**: Include Material as an option in the product description with predefined options and manual input, and offer predefined categorized colors with manual input. Sizes should also be categorized with multi-select.
5.  **Customer Profile**: Extend customer profiles to include customer number, email, company name, first name, last name, customer since (optional), and a status (Starter, Business, Gold, Platinum) to be displayed with an icon in the profile.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a **WhatsApp-style camera integration** for product media uploads. This feature allows users to directly capture photos using their device's camera or select existing media from their library, replacing the previous simple file upload mechanism.

The implementation involved:
1.  ** Component**: A new modal was created to provide a choice between Kamera (Camera) and Foto- und Videomediathek (Photo and Video Library). It features a modern design with clear icons for intuitive selection.
2.  ** Component**: This new component handles the direct camera access, displaying a live preview, allowing front/rear camera switching, and enabling photo capture. Error handling for camera permissions is also included.

These components were integrated into . The existing media upload section was replaced with a new button that triggers the . New state variables and functions were added to manage the modal's visibility, handle the captured photos, and integrate them into the product media library, ensuring compatibility with existing file upload logic.

The feature was tested using the automated testing agent, which verified:
*   Successful admin login and access to the product creation section.
*   Correct rendering of the new green gradient button for media upload.
*   Proper opening and closing of the .
*   Functional camera integration with live preview and photo capture capabilities.
*   Accessibility to the device's media gallery for file selection.

A recurring ESLint warning regarding an undefined 'setCustomerId' was noted in  but not addressed as part of this task. The AI engineer concluded that the camera integration is fully functional and ready for user verification.
