The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles an intensive, iterative development process focused primarily on resolving the persistent challenge of **automatic Zebra label printing** within a Kubernetes containerized environment. Initial efforts involved fixing chat functionality (real-time updates, timezones, emoji reactions) and integrating LiveKit for streaming, but the bulk of the conversation revolves around the printer.

Key decisions included a shift from direct container printing (due to CUPS not being present/accessible) to various host-side interaction methods: initially manual  instructions, then web-based preview and CSV export, then a dedicated Flask host-side service, then an automatic shell script execution, and finally, a file-sharing system with a Mac auto-printer script. Each attempt was met with user feedback highlighting the failure to achieve *truly* automatic printing. The AI demonstrated persistence, leveraging  to diagnose environment-specific issues (e.g., CUPS not installed, container isolation). The final proposed solution involves a Mac-side file watcher and sync script, aiming for full automation.

The Live Shopping App is a full-stack platform integrating live streaming, chat, and product ordering, with administrative features. The user explicitly requested a modern UI/UX (dark theme, glassmorphism, collapsible sections for customers, refactored admin dashboard), core bug fixes (timezone), robust chat functionality (real-time, chronological, auto-scroll, sender info, specific emojis), registration enhancements (kostenlos text, paragraph removal), and stable LiveKit-based live streaming (real-time video/audio, active stream indication, restricted to authenticated customers/admin).

The most challenging and iterated feature has been the **Automatic Zebra Label Printing**: labels (40x25mm) must automatically print upon new order confirmation from a Zebra GK420d printer, containing customer number, price, and timestamp. Admin previews (image or PDF) were also requested. Other pending features include a desktop split-screen layout for orders and chat, and resolution of customer creation/login issues (specifically customer 10299 not found or new customers not appearing).

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB.



- :
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI application.
    - **Changes Made**: New API endpoints (, , , , ) for Zebra printer management were added. The  function was modified to trigger label printing logic and later to interact with the new host-side or file-sharing mechanisms. File sharing endpoint  was added.
- :
    - **Importance**: Encapsulates Zebra printer communication and ZPL generation.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial implementation of  was fixed (missing  statement).
        -  was corrected to  and later to the full USB connection string.
        - Logic for PDF/image preview was added.
        - Functions for generating print-friendly HTML and CSV for mail merge were added.
        - Automatic printing logic was adapted from direct CUPS calls to host-side service communication, then to shell script execution, and finally to writing ZPL files to a shared directory.
- :
    - **Importance**: LiveKit token generation.
    - **Changes Made**: No direct changes.
- :
    - **Importance**: *New file* (Flask application) for host-side printing, designed to run on the user's Mac.
    - **Changes Made**: Created to receive ZPL data from the container and print using . This approach was later deprecated due to complexity.
- :
    - **Importance**: Central React component for UI.
    - **Changes Made**: Admin Dashboard UI for Zebra printer management (status, test print, ZPL download, PDF/image preview, HTML print preview, CSV download) was extensively modified and expanded. New buttons and corresponding API calls were added to trigger the various printing and preview mechanisms. The logic for downloading ZPL and displaying print commands in a popup was added.
- :
    - **Importance**: Frontend environment variables.
    - **Changes Made**: Checked and confirmed .
- :
    - **Importance**: Backend environment variables.
    - **Changes Made**: Checked  and .
- :
    - **Importance**: Frontend dependencies.
    - **Changes Made**:  was confirmed installed.

    - **Importance**: Backend dependencies.
    - **Changes Made**: , , and  were added for printer and preview functionalities.
- :
    - **Importance**: *New file* designed to run on the user's Mac.
    - **Changes Made**: Created as a Python script to watch a local directory for ZPL files and automatically print them using .
- :
    - **Importance**: *New file* designed to run on the user's Mac.
    - **Changes Made**: Created as a shell script to synchronize ZPL files from the container's shared folder to the Mac's watched folder.

<pending_tasks>
- **Customer Creation/Login Issue**: Investigate and fix the customer creation/login problem (kunden sind nicht angelegt, customer 10299 not found/not created in admin).
- **Implement Desktop Split-Screen Layout**: Implement a desktop view where Orders and Chat are displayed side-by-side. The user needs to confirm the preferred column ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40, 40/60).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on achieving **truly automatic Zebra label printing** without any manual intervention from the user. The previous attempts at host-side Flask services, shell script execution, and manual download/copy-paste methods were deemed insufficient by the user who insisted on full automation.

The current solution involves a new architecture to bypass container isolation:
1.  A **Python script ()** is created, intended to run persistently on the user's macOS host. This script watches a designated local directory () for new ZPL files. Upon detection, it automatically executes  to print the label on the specified Zebra GK420d printer and then archives the file.
2.  The **backend ()** is updated to write generated ZPL files into a shared volume accessible from the container.
3.  A **shell script ()** is created, also intended to run on the user's Mac, to periodically synchronize the ZPL files from the container's shared volume to the local watched directory ().

The AI has just completed the implementation of these components and confirmed their functionality via backend tests, claiming echtes automatisches Drucken (real automatic printing) is now achieved. It has provided the user with complete setup instructions for their Mac, including creating directories, downloading/creating the Python and shell scripts, and running them in the background. The current state is that the user needs to perform this one-time setup on their Mac to enable the full automation.
