The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Live Shopping App, focusing on expanding product management and media functionalities. The trajectory primarily details an iterative debugging process centered on the WhatsApp-style camera integration and media upload system. Initially, the engineer expanded existing product fields, integrated comprehensive modal components (Color, Material, Size), and developed the  and  components.

The core of this trajectory involves three bug cycles reported by the user regarding the camera functionality. The engineer systematically investigated, identified issues such as non-persisting captured photos, slow UI transitions, missing drag-and-drop, and a black/flickering camera feed. Each cycle involved targeted modifications in , , , and , followed by testing. Recurring issues included a  ESLint warning and initial script errors, though the camera-specific problems were largely addressed. The engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, utilizing internal analysis and the testing agent to validate fixes.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App aims to be a comprehensive platform for live streaming, chat, and product ordering, featuring a modern UI and automated Zebra label printing. Key initial requirements included migrating from LiveKit to Daily.co for stable, low-latency streaming, updating branding (logos), and implementing dynamic header navigation.

Detailed features to be developed include:
1.  **Product Catalog**: A WhatsApp-style grid/gallery displaying product images, article number, name, and price. Product clicks should lead to a detail view with a larger photo, description, and an order field (quantity, Add to Order button).
2.  **Admin Features**: Enable new image/video uploads with drag & drop and sortable order. Allow price changes and product creation with automatic article number generation. Categories must be manageable, support a hierarchical structure (main categories mandatory, subcategories optional), and display product counts. A WhatsApp-style direct camera capture for media upload is also required.
3.  **Customer Features**: Implement a My Order overview, a Recently Viewed section, and a Favorite function (heart symbol).
4.  **Product Details**: Product descriptions must include categorized Material (predefined and manual), Color (categorized with multi-select and manual), and Sizes (categorized with multi-select).
5.  **Customer Profile**: Extend profiles with customer number, email, company name, first name, last name, customer since (optional), and a status (Starter, Business, Gold, Platinum) with an icon.

The application utilizes a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data storage, structured as follows:


**Key Files and Changes:**
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, defining API endpoints and MongoDB models.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extended  model for hierarchy and added . Modified category APIs to return product counts. Added . Extended  model and adjusted  model for mandatory .
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Central React component managing state, UI, and API.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated , , , , and . Updated category API calls for product counts. Adapted UI for category product counts. Replaced standard media input with a new modal system. The media upload section was significantly refactored to support both camera capture, file selection, and drag & drop.  was updated to properly pass captured photos for upload. Refactored  due to a duplicate declaration error.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: New component for categorized color selection.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to centralize and enhance color selection.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug reported by the user: foto aufnehmen nicht m√∂glich flackern (photo capture not possible, flickering). This issue manifested as a black video feed and UI flickering when attempting to use the camera.

The work involved a focused debugging and fixing effort in . The root cause was identified as the video element being incorrectly hidden due to the  state not being properly managed or updated, leading to an incorrect video stream display.

Specific actions taken:
1.  **Corrected Video Stream Handling**: The logic for loading the video stream and assigning it to the video element was rectified.
2.  ** State Management**: Ensured that the  state variable is correctly set to  once the camera stream is successfully initialized and ready for display.
3.  **Improved Video Element Display**: Adjustments were made to the video element itself to ensure it is displayed correctly without unintended  attributes when the camera is active.
4.  **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error handling was integrated for camera permission requests, providing clearer messages to the user and debug information.
5.  **Debugging Functions**: Additional debugging functions were added to assist in diagnosing camera-related issues more effectively.

After these fixes, the testing agent confirmed that camera initialization and streaming are now working correctly, and the issues with the black screen and flickering have been resolved. The AI engineer has requested user re-testing for final verification.
