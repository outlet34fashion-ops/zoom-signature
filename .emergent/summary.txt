The AI engineer's trajectory details an iterative development process. Initially, it involved addressing a new user request to implement manual customer creation by an admin, followed by displaying the last order with timestamp for customers. During this, the engineer refactored the UI to move the customer profile to a separate modal in the header and made device-specific view buttons admin-only. Subsequently, several critical bugs emerged: orders not appearing in chat or the last order section, failed customer login, and an inability to create customers. The engineer leveraged the  to identify and resolve these issues, discovering a misconfigured  and, later, an incorrect WebSocket protocol ( instead of ). Each bug was systematically analyzed and fixed, demonstrating a methodical approach to debugging and ensuring core application functionalities were robust.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App facilitates live streaming, real-time chat, and product ordering, with an admin dashboard for management.
1.  **Order Messages in Chat**: Orders must appear in the chat feed in . The Bestellung prefix must be bold.
2.  **Regular Chat Messages**: , with emoji support.
3.  **Customer Authentication**: Robust system for existing customer login (customer number) and new customer registration.
4.  **UI Split View**: Main display area split into Bestellungen (Orders) and Chat tabs.
5.  **Manual Customer Creation (Admin)**: Admins must be able to manually create customers, providing customer number, name, and email. Customers created this way are automatically set to active.
6.  **Display Last Order with Timestamp**: For each customer, the latest order, including its time, should be displayed in a compact format (e.g., 1 I 12,90 I OneSize + product name + timestamp). This block should be positioned below the order form.
7.  **Customer Profile in Header**: Mein Profil should be a separate, accessible button in the top navigation bar, visible only to customers, leading to a modal with profile details.
8.  **Admin-Only Device Buttons**: The 3 device-specific view buttons (handy, tablet, desktop) should only be visible to admins, hidden from customer view.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with Python FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.



-   : Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Handles API endpoints, WebSocket communication, and customer/order management.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Added  endpoint for manual customer creation, including validation for unique customer numbers and emails, and setting status to active.
        -   Added  endpoint to fetch the last order details for a specific customer.
        -   Ensured  resolution and order message formatting remained correct through WebSocket notifications.

-   : Primary React component.
    -   **Importance**: Manages application state, UI logic, user interactions, and communication with the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Manual Customer Creation**: Integrated UI for admin dashboard, including a modal for  with input fields for customer number, name, and email. (,  functions).
        -   **Last Order Display**:
            -   Added  state and  function to fetch the last order.
            -    hook to load last order on customer change and after .
            -   UI element for  in a compact format, showing quantity, price, size, product name, and timestamp. This block was moved below the order form.
        -   **Profile UI**:
            -   Moved Mein Profil from the sidebar to a button in the header navigation.
            -   Implemented a  to display customer profile details (picture, customer number) in a separate modal, visible only to logged-in customers.
            -   Removed profile display from the main content area to reduce clutter.
        -   **Device Buttons Visibility**: Modified rendering logic so that the device selector buttons (Handy, Tablet, Desktop) are only visible when  is true.
        -   **Bug Fixes**:
            -   Corrected  function to remove manual chat message sending, relying solely on backend WebSocket notifications for order messages.
            -   Improved error handling for .
            -   Fixed  in  from a preview environment URL to  to ensure correct local backend communication.
            -   Corrected WebSocket connection protocol from  to  for local development to .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical authentication and order display bugs. The problem was that after implementing features like manual customer creation and last order display, customers could not log in, create new accounts, or see their orders in the chat or last order section. Initial debugging showed the backend worked, but the frontend had issues.

The root causes identified and fixed were:
1.  **Incorrect **: The frontend's  file was pointing to a preview environment URL () instead of . This was fixed by updating  to  and restarting services.
2.  **WebSocket Protocol Mismatch**: The frontend was attempting a secure WebSocket connection () to an insecure local backend (). This was fixed by changing the WebSocket URL in  to .

The engineer confirmed that a test customer  exists and is active in the database. With the  and WebSocket protocol fixes, the system should now allow customer login, registration, chat functionality, orders, and real-time updates. The last action was the final fix for the WebSocket issue.
