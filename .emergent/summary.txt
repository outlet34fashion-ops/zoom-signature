The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining the Live Shopping application, moving from initial setup to addressing complex real-time communication and customer management issues. The trajectory shows an iterative problem-solving approach, starting with a user's report about order messages not appearing in the chat and evolving to uncover deeper architectural inconsistencies. The initial diagnosis incorrectly assumed the  function was sending correct messages, leading to a backend API investigation. The critical discovery was that the  API endpoint in  was not returning the , causing frontend display issues. After fixing this backend bug, the engineer provided detailed testing instructions to the user. However, the order display bug persisted, prompting a new requirement for bold formatting of Bestellung and a renewed focus on frontend chat display logic. The work halted at the point of initiating a detailed frontend analysis for the persistent order display and formatting issues.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App facilitates live streaming (YouTube Live), real-time chat, and product ordering, supporting multi-language and responsive design. Core features include an admin dashboard for order management and resets, UI refinements (order display, chat message formatting, compact header, product selection for admins), and robust live video streaming. A comprehensive customer management system was introduced, featuring a backend database, admin interface (add, block, unblock, edit), frontend signup, and admin approval. Enhancements included admin login (PIN 1924), Admin chat tags, customer login/logout chat messages, customer filtering/sorting, push notifications for new registrations, and customer-managed profile picture uploads (displaying only customer numbers publicly).
The current, explicit user requirements are:
1.  **Order messages must appear directly in the chat.**
2.  **Order messages must follow the format:** . (e.g., )
3.  **Regular chat messages must follow the format:** . (e.g., )
4.  **The Bestellung prefix for order messages should be displayed in bold.**

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI:** Python framework for backend APIs and WebSockets.
-   **React:** JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
-   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data persistence.
-   **WebSockets:** For real-time chat and notifications.
-   **Base64 Encoding:** Used for transmitting profile images.
-   **API Design:** RESTful API endpoints for customer management and chat.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture, combining a Python FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   : The main FastAPI application, handling backend logic for chat, orders, and customer management.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes all API endpoints and WebSocket handling.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  API endpoint () was modified to explicitly include  in its JSON response, addressing a critical bug that prevented correct customer number display on the frontend. It also supports customer CRUD operations and profile image handling.

-   : The primary React component, managing global state, routing, and UI for both admin and customer views.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates application flow, user authentication, customer management dashboard, chat, and order placement.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains the  and  functions which are central to the current bug. The  function processes the customer status from the backend. The code logic for sending chat and order messages was initially believed to be correct, but issues with customer number display (due to a backend omission) and persistent order message display problems indicate potential further frontend adjustments are needed, specifically in how messages are rendered or dispatched via WebSockets.

-   : Python dependencies.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures all necessary Python libraries for the backend are installed.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit recent changes mentioned in the trajectory.

-    & : Environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Configures  for the frontend and  for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: No modifications were made to these files during the trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure order messages are displayed in the chat.
-   Implement bold formatting for the Bestellung prefix in order messages.
-   Confirm chat messages (both regular and order-related) use the correct, actual customer number (not 10299).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent issue where order messages were not being displayed in the chat, despite a prior fix for the  being correctly returned by the backend API. The user re-confirmed that orders are not showing and requested that the Bestellung prefix be displayed in bold. The AI had just re-examined the  function in  (lines 660-690) and found its logic to be seemingly correct, leading to the conclusion that a detailed frontend analysis is required to diagnose why the messages are not appearing and to implement the requested bold formatting. The current state is that the backend API provides the correct customer number, but the frontend's display logic for order messages in the chat, including formatting, is still problematic.

<optional_next_step>
Conduct a detailed frontend analysis to determine why order messages are not appearing in the chat and implement bold formatting for Bestellung.
