The AI engineer successfully transformed a nascent live shopping application by addressing several complex requirements. Initially, the core streaming functionality was migrated from LiveKit to a more stable Daily.co, alongside essential branding updates and dynamic header adjustments. The bulk of the work focused on building a comprehensive product catalog system, complete with backend models, APIs, and a user-friendly React frontend. This included features like category management, precise size ordering, robust drag-and-drop media uploads, and critical bug fixes for product visibility. Subsequent iterations added advanced capabilities such as product search, recently viewed items, favorite product tagging, and flexible color options. Finally, the customer profile was extended with new data fields and status display, and a hierarchical category system was implemented. The engineer demonstrated a systematic approach, using iterative development, rigorous backend testing, and visual frontend verification, though a subtle frontend issue with the extended customer profile persisted at the end of the trajectory.

The Live Shopping App aims to provide a platform for live streaming, chat, and product ordering, featuring a modern UI and automatic Zebra label printing. The initial focus was on replacing an unstable LiveKit streaming solution with a low-latency, reliable Daily.co integration, followed by branding updates (new logos) and dynamic header navigation (login/logout buttons, header visibility based on authentication).

Subsequent detailed requirements emerged:
1.  **Product Catalog**: Implement a WhatsApp-style grid/gallery with product images, article number, name, price. Clicking a product should open a detail view with a larger photo, description, and an order field (quantity + Add to Order button).
2.  **Admin Features**: Enable new image/video uploads with drag & drop and sortable order. Allow price changes and product creation with automatic article number generation (starting from 1 if not manually entered). Categories should be manageable and support a hierarchical structure (main categories mandatory, subcategories optional for products).
3.  **Customer Features**: Provide a My Order overview, a Recently Viewed section, and a Favorite function with a heart symbol for quick access.
4.  **Product Details**: Include Material as an option in the product description and offer predefined colors (Schwarz, Wei√ü, Blau, Rot, Beige) with manual input capability.
5.  **Customer Profile**: Extend customer profiles to include customer number, email, company name, first name, last name, customer since (optional), and a status (Starter, Business, Gold, Platinum) to be displayed with an icon in the profile.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data storage.



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, defining API endpoints and MongoDB models.
    -   **Changes Made**: Expanded significantly to include , , , ,  models. Added CRUD APIs, file upload endpoints, automatic article number generation, and  events for default data (categories). Customer and Product models were extended with new fields (e.g., , , , , , ). Crucially, a duplicate hardcoded  endpoint was removed to correctly serve products from the database.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: New directory created to store product image and video uploads.
    -   **Changes Made**: Directory created for static file serving.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The central React component, handling application state, UI rendering, and API interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Underwent extensive refactoring. LiveKit components were replaced with Daily.co. New states, functions, and UI logic were added for the entire product catalog system, including the Katalog button, , Admin Product/Category Management, search field, Recently Viewed section, and favorite functionality. Product creation forms were updated for sizes, media uploads (drag & drop), material, colors, and hierarchical categories. Customer creation forms and the customer profile display were enhanced to show new customer fields and status.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides global styling.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  utility class for text truncation.

-   **Implement Desktop Split-Screen Layout**: Display Orders and Chat side-by-side in a desktop view, with the user to confirm the preferred column ratio.
-   **Mac Auto-Printer Files**: Provide the user with the complete  and  files for their Mac setup.
-   **Customer Profile Frontend Display**: Resolve frontend display issues for the extended customer profile fields (e.g., Mitglied seit, Status, trophy icon) which encountered errors during the last testing phase.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of a comprehensive **hierarchical category system** and the **extension of the customer profile** with additional fields.

For the hierarchical categories, the backend's  model in  was updated to include  and , enabling a parent-child relationship. The  model was modified to make referencing a  mandatory and a  optional. Corresponding API endpoints were developed to manage and retrieve these hierarchical categories, and a  event was added to  to auto-create default main and subcategories upon backend launch. On the frontend,  was extensively modified to allow administrators to select main and subcategories during product creation, and the main catalog navigation was updated to reflect this new hierarchical structure, including collapsible sections. Backend tests for this feature passed with 100% success.

Concurrently, the customer profile was enhanced. The  model in  was extended to include new fields such as , , , , , , and . The frontend in  was updated to present these new input fields in the customer creation form and to display them prominently within the customer's profile modal. This display included conditional rendering for a trophy icon when the status field is empty. Backend testing successfully verified the functionality of these new customer profile fields. However, during the final frontend verification, issues like logout timeouts and errors in accessing or rendering the profile modal were observed, indicating that while the backend supports these fields, their complete and stable display on the frontend still requires attention.

Investigate and resolve the frontend issues preventing the correct display of the extended customer profile (member since, status, trophy icon).
