This trajectory captures the AI engineer's work on a Live Shopping App. The initial context provided the application's current state, including recent customer data migration. The user reported a critical bug: the Kategorie erstellen button was non-functional, and requested a new feature for drag-and-drop category reordering. The AI first analyzed the backend to confirm API functionality, identifying that the issue was frontend-centric and that a  field was already supported. The engineer then implemented frontend fixes for category and subcategory creation, including  calculation and drag-and-drop capabilities. A new backend endpoint for batch  updates was added for efficiency. Extensive testing, including screenshots and automated frontend/backend checks, verified the successful resolution of both the button bug (identified as user confusion) and the implementation of category reordering. The work demonstrates a methodical approach to debugging and feature implementation, ensuring robust verification.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App is a platform for live shopping, chat, and product ordering, featuring a modern UI and automated Zebra label printing, requiring robust product and category management. Key implemented features include:
-  for hierarchical categories (main/subcategories) with drag-and-drop sorting.
- Material Properties modal for product specifics.
- Reordered product creation input fields (Price, Stock, Sizes, Colors, Material, Material Properties).
- Mobile optimization for the product catalog header and main product listings, displaying two items side-by-side with horizontal scrolling.
- Horizontal, scrollable category tabs.
- Admin capabilities to view, edit, mark as ausverkauft (out of stock), ausblenden (hide), and löschen (delete) products.
- Removal of Kürzlich angesehen (recently viewed) section.
- Favoriten (favorites) button and modal, exclusively in the catalog header.
- Customer database cleanup and import of new customer data from a CSV, mapping specified columns.
- **New requirements from this trajectory**: Kategorie erstellen button must reliably create new categories. Categories must be reorderable via drag-and-drop, with changes immediately saved and visible.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Backend API development for product, category, and customer management, including new batch update endpoints.
- **React**: Frontend UI development with functional components, state management, and drag-and-drop UI (likely using a library for D&D).
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data persistence, storing .
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for responsive design.
- **Yarn**: Frontend package management.
- **CSV Parsing**: Handling and importing customer data from CSV files (from previous work).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard MERN-like stack (MongoDB, Express/FastAPI, React, Node.js/Python).



- :
    - **Importance**: Core backend API for products, categories, and customers. It handles CRUD operations and now includes a new endpoint.
    - **Changes Made**: Confirmed existing  and  APIs. Verified  model includes  and . New endpoints were likely used for customer data backup, deletion, and import during the migration process. **Added a new  endpoint to efficiently update the  for multiple categories/subcategories.**

- :
    - **Importance**: Central React component, handles application state, UI logic, API calls, and renders various sections and modals.
    - **Changes Made**: Integrated , . Added states (, , , , ). Implemented functions: , , , , . Modified  handlers for category tabs to load and display subcategories. Adjusted product display for mobile (2-column, horizontal scroll) and desktop layouts. Removed Oberteile category tab. Added an Produkte button in admin catalog management to display all products. Added admin-only Edit, Ausverkauft/Verfügbar, Ausblenden/Einblenden, and Löschen buttons to product cards (mobile and desktop). Created  and . Removed Kürzlich angesehen section, its toggle button, states, and related functions. Placed Meine Bestellung and Favoriten buttons exclusively in the product catalog header. **No direct explicit changes were mentioned in this trajectory to App.js, but it likely coordinates with the  through state or props.**

- :
    - **Importance**: Manages main and subcategories. This modal was the primary focus of the recent work.
    - **Changes Made**: Explicitly confirmed to have working subcategory creation and drag-and-drop sorting functionality. **Significant changes were made to fix the Kategorie erstellen button functionality, implement  calculation for new categories/subcategories, and integrate drag-and-drop functionality for both main categories and subcategories. The component was also updated to utilize the new backend batch-update endpoint for sorting.**

- :
    - **Importance**: New modal for managing material properties.
    - **Changes Made**: Created as a copy of , serving its specific purpose. No further changes mentioned in this trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement Desktop Split-Screen Layout to display Orders and Chat side-by-side.
- Provide the complete  and  files for Mac setup.
- Resolve frontend display issues for the extended customer profile fields (e.g., Mitglied seit, Status, trophy icon).
- Add images to articles for display in the product catalog.
- Address backend product API validation errors if they impact product display or sorting.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer addressed a user-reported bug and feature request concerning category management. The core issue was a non-functional Kategorie erstellen (Create Category) button and the absence of category reordering functionality.

The AI engineer's work involved:
1.  **Diagnosis**: Backend APIs for category creation and  were verified to be functional. The button bug was identified as user confusion, as the  itself was working correctly, but the user was clicking the wrong button.
2.  **Frontend Implementation ()**:
    *   Ensured the Kategorie erstellen button correctly triggers category creation within the modal.
    *   Implemented logic to assign a  to newly created categories and subcategories.
    *   Integrated drag-and-drop functionality for both main categories and subcategories, allowing users to reorder them directly within the modal.
3.  **Backend Enhancement ()**:
    *   A new  endpoint was added to allow for efficient updates of multiple category/subcategory  fields in a single API call, improving performance for drag-and-drop operations.
4.  **Integration**: The frontend  was updated to utilize this new batch update endpoint for saving sort order changes.
5.  **Verification**: Extensive testing was performed, including navigating the admin dashboard, opening the Category Management Modal, and confirming both category creation and drag-and-drop reordering worked as expected. This included both manual verification via screenshots and automated testing.

The user's reported bug and requested feature have been successfully implemented and verified.
