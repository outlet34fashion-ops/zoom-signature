The AI engineer's trajectory details a highly iterative development process, initially inheriting a challenging task of automatic Zebra label printing, which it addressed through host-side scripts. The bulk of the provided trajectory, however, showcases extensive UI/UX improvements based on explicit user feedback. The engineer systematically tackled requests such as collapsing UI sections, removing non-functional elements, refining input fields, and implementing sticky navigation bars. A significant new feature, an appointment (Termine) system with push notifications, was also fully implemented. The approach demonstrates a strong focus on user satisfaction, iterating rapidly, and performing comprehensive tests after each change, ensuring a clean, functional, and user-friendly application.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App is a full-stack platform for live streaming, chat, and product ordering. Initial requirements included a modern UI/UX (dark theme, glassmorphism, collapsible sections, refactored admin dashboard), core bug fixes (timezone), robust chat, registration enhancements, and stable LiveKit-based streaming.

The most complex feature was **Automatic Zebra Label Printing** (40x25mm labels with customer number, price, timestamp upon order confirmation; admin previews).

During the current trajectory, the user explicitly requested:
1.  Admin dashboard boxes to be **collapsed by default**.
2.  Removal of a **non-functional Live Stream Control window** and its placeholder.
3.  Size selection: Replace A4xx with **AAxx** and implement a **manual, editable size input field** that populates with the last selected value.
4.  Price input: Display **price and size input fields on one line**, make the **price input manual and editable**, showing the entered value (e.g., 5.00 for 5,00) instead of 0.
5.  Removal of **blue and green Action Buttons**.
6.  Customer view sections Deine letzte Bestellung and Top 3 KÃ¤ufer to be **collapsed by default**.
7.  Move **streaming video to the top** in the customer view and **remove Live Shopping Funktionen info text**.
8.  Make the **pink ticker bar sticky** and position it at the very top.
9.  Make the **main header/navigation bar sticky** as well, positioned below the ticker.
10. Move **language selection from the header to the customer profile modal**.
11. The **ticker bar should only appear for logged-in users**, not on the landing page.
12. Add a **Termine** (Appointments) button leading to a list of appointments with a **reminder function** for customers, triggering **push notifications** upon activation.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB.



- :
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI backend, handles API routes and business logic.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Product definitions updated for size changes (A4xx to AAxx).
        - New API endpoints for customer reminders (, ) added, including logic for setting, fetching, and deleting reminders, and a background task for sending push notifications.
- :
    - **Importance**: Encapsulates Zebra printer communication and ZPL generation.
    - **Changes Made**: Initial setup and logic for ZPL generation, file writing for Mac-side printing. (Changes were pre-trajectory, but context is important).
- :
    - **Importance**: Central React component, orchestrates UI rendering and state.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Admin dashboard collapsible states (, etc.) set to  by default.
        - Rendering of  component removed.
        - Customer view collapsible states (, ) set to .
        - UI logic for manual size and price input fields, including states (, ).
        - Layout adjusted for size/price fields to be on one line.
        - Removed Action Buttons (Next Article, Send Price & Size).
        - Reordered components to place live stream video at the very top of the customer view.
        - Removed Live Shopping Funktionen informational text.
        - Implemented sticky header and ticker bars ( for ticker,  for header).
        - Adjusted main content padding (, ) dynamically.
        - Language selector moved from header to , which was integrated into the fixed header.
        - Ticker bar rendering made conditional based on user authentication status.
        - Added Termine button to the fixed header (conditional on authentication).
        - Integrated  component, states (, , ), and functions (, ).
        -  added to load events and reminders on login.
- :
    - **Importance**: Python script for user's Mac to watch for ZPL files and print.
    - **Changes Made**: Created to provide host-side automation for Zebra printing. (Pre-trajectory, but context is important).
- :
    - **Importance**: Shell script for user's Mac to sync ZPL files from container to Mac.
    - **Changes Made**: Created to facilitate host-side automation for Zebra printing. (Pre-trajectory, but context is important).

<pending_tasks>
- **Customer Creation/Login Issue**: Investigate and fix the customer creation/login problem (kunden sind nicht angelegt, customer 10299 not found/not created in admin).
- **Implement Desktop Split-Screen Layout**: Implement a desktop view where Orders and Chat are displayed side-by-side. The user needs to confirm the preferred column ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40, 40/60).
- **Mac Auto-Printer Files**: Provide the user with the complete  and  files for their Mac setup (this was developed prior to the UI/UX tasks but has not yet been delivered to the user for setup).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented the Termine (Appointments) feature. This involved:

**Frontend ():**
- A new  variable, , was introduced to control the visibility of the appointment modal.
- A Termine button was added to the fixed header bar, visible only to authenticated customers.
- A  component was created, displaying a list of upcoming live shopping events. It includes ðŸ”” Erinnern (Remind) and ðŸ”• Erinnerung aus (Reminder off) buttons for each event.
- Functions  and  were implemented to manage customer reminders via API calls.
- A  hook was added to load events and customer-specific reminders upon user login.

**Backend ():**
- Pydantic models for  and  were defined for data validation and serialization.
- Three new API endpoints were added:
    - : To set a new reminder for a customer for a specific event.
    - : To remove an existing reminder.
    - : To retrieve all active reminders for a given customer.
- These endpoints interact with MongoDB to store and retrieve reminder information.
- The backend includes logic to process and send push notifications to customers 30 minutes before a scheduled event if they have an active reminder.

The feature is fully functional, allowing customers to view upcoming events and set/unset reminders, with the system capable of sending push notifications.
