The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development process driven by user requests and numerous bug fixes. Initially, core features like manual customer creation, last order display, and UI refactoring (profile to modal, admin-only device buttons) were implemented. A series of critical bugs then emerged, mainly related to  misconfigurations, WebSocket protocol mismatches, and  or  serialization issues in both local and preview environments. The engineer systematically used  to pinpoint and resolve these. Subsequent efforts focused on extensive UI/UX refinements for the landing page, including logo integration, WhatsApp service integration, specific button reordering, text adjustments, and crucial mobile optimization. A Live Shopping Calendar feature was also implemented, requiring further serialization fixes. The persistent environment and deployment-specific bugs, particularly  in deployed settings and React rendering issues due to debug logs or WebSocket protocols, required significant troubleshooting. The trajectory concludes with a critical fix to the  for the deployed , awaiting redeployment.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App aims to provide a real-time platform for live streaming, chat, and product ordering, with administrative tools.

**Core Requirements & Implemented Features:**
1.  **Order Messages in Chat**: Orders appear in chat as **Bestellung** [CustomerNumber] I [Quantity]x I [Price] I [Size], with Bestellung bolded.
2.  **Regular Chat Messages**: Format , with emoji support.
3.  **Customer Authentication**: Login for existing customers (customer number) and registration for new ones.
4.  **UI Split View**: Main display area split into Bestellungen and Chat tabs.
5.  **Manual Customer Creation (Admin)**: Admins create customers (number, name, email) with automatic active status.
6.  **Display Last Order with Timestamp**: Latest order with timestamp in a compact format below the order form.
7.  **Customer Profile in Header**: Mein Profil button in header, leading to a modal with profile details, visible only to logged-in customers.
8.  **Admin-Only Device Buttons**: Device selector buttons (Handy, Tablet, Desktop) visible only to admins.
9.  **WhatsApp Service Integration**: Add a click-to-chat WhatsApp button with a specified number (0176 21105848) on the landing page, and a subtle icon in the customer view header. The button should be pink/magenta with a WhatsApp logo and display Service Nummer.
10. **Live Shopping Calendar**: Implement an event calendar where admins can create/edit/delete events (date, time, topic), and customers can view upcoming events. Expired events should be hidden, and customers should receive push notifications for upcoming events (30 minutes prior).
11. **Mobile Optimization**: The application must be optimized for smartphone users (80% of traffic), including touch-friendly buttons, responsive text sizes, and Progressive Web App (PWA) features.
12. **Landing Page Customization**: Adjust welcome text for new customers, button texts (Login to zum Login, Registrieren to App Registrierung), and specific button arrangements/ordering.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with Python FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.



-   : Main FastAPI application, handles API endpoints, WebSocket communication, and data management.
    -   **Importance**: Central hub for backend logic, authentication, customer/order handling, and Live Shopping Calendar.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Added  endpoint for manual customer creation, including unique validation and setting status to active.
        -   Added  endpoint for fetching last order details.
        -   Implemented  Pydantic model for calendar events.
        -   Added CRUD API endpoints (, , ) for the Live Shopping Calendar.
        -   Included an endpoint for sending push notifications .
        -   **Fixes**: Resolved  and  JSON serialization issues for both customer and event creation/retrieval by explicitly converting  to uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) string and handling  objects.
        -   Corrected WebSocket order message format to include  for bolding in chat.

-   : Primary React component, manages UI, state, and frontend-backend communication.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates user interaction, displays data, and handles all client-side logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Manual Customer Creation**: Integrated UI for admin dashboard (modal with input fields).
        -   **Last Order Display**: Added state and function to fetch/display last order in a compact format with timestamp. Corrected price format to use comma (e.g., 12,90).
        -   **Profile UI**: Moved Mein Profil to header, implemented .
        -   **Device Buttons Visibility**: Made device selector buttons admin-only.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug in the deployed application where customer creation and order placement were failing. Despite multiple backend fixes (for serialization, datetime handling, and chat message formatting), and extensive UI/UX enhancements (WhatsApp integration, mobile optimization, calendar features), the deployed frontend was still unable to communicate correctly with the backend.

The root cause was precisely identified: the  file, which dictates the , was incorrectly pointing to a preview environment URL (). In the deployed (live) environment, this URL must point to the actual live backend URL (). The engineer has just made this critical correction to the  file. This fix is crucial for the deployed application to function correctly. The next immediate step is to redeploy the application to apply this updated configuration.
