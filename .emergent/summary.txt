The trajectory chronicles a complex development journey, beginning with verifying a pre-existing WebRTC live streaming implementation. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested to replace WebRTC with LiveKit Cloud, specifying stringent requirements for quality and mobile optimization. This LiveKit integration became a major focus, marked by numerous bug reports related to React Context, rendering race conditions, connection timeouts, and video display. Despite multiple architectural refactorings and direct API interventions, the LiveKit solution remained unstable. Consequently, the AI engineer decided to revert to a simpler, native WebRTC solution. This re-established basic video streaming, which was then directly embedded into the customer's main view. The final stage involved replacing an inactive stream's blank placeholder with an animated Live Shopping Countdown, enhancing user experience. The work concludes with a new request to fully update the application's design.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App offers live streaming, chat, product ordering, and comprehensive admin features.
**Initial Core Requirements:** Chat (order/regular, emojis), Customer Auth, UI split view, Admin customer creation, Last order display, Customer profile (picture, language, logout), Admin-only device buttons, WhatsApp integration, Live Shopping Calendar, Mobile optimization, Customizable landing page, Countdown timer, Live admin statistics, Top 3 Buyers, Chat pinning, and **Live Video Streaming (WebRTC)**.
**LiveKit Streaming Evolution:** The WebRTC was to be replaced by **LiveKit Cloud** with specific demands: Admin publisher via iPhone (Safari, 1080p@30fps, 3.5‚Äì5 Mbit/s), view-only viewers, Simulcast/AdaptiveStream for low latency, H.264 for iOS, UI with Start/Stop, Live-Badge, Viewer Count, Chat, Token-Server, Mobile-first (Auto-Reconnect, Mute/Unmute, Camera-Swap), and display of metrics (RTT, Bitrate, FPS, Packet-Loss).
**Current State:** The unstable LiveKit was replaced by a **simple native WebRTC solution**. This stream is now directly embedded into the customer view. If no stream is active, an **animated Live Shopping Countdown** (based on a user-provided image) is displayed instead of an empty video area. The next explicit request is a complete design overhaul based on Bild 2.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented a stable, simple WebRTC video streaming solution, , after abandoning the problematic LiveKit Cloud integration. This  component is now directly embedded into the customer-facing main page (), aiming to provide an immediate live stream view upon login.

Following user feedback that the video was not always displayed (showing a black area when no stream was active), the AI engineer replaced this empty placeholder with a dynamic, animated Live Shopping Countdown interface. This involved:
1.  Modifying  and  to conditionally render the countdown.
2.  Integrating visual elements: an animated fire icon, üõçÔ∏è LIVE SHOPPING COUNTDOWN header, sale labels, and a gradient background.
3.  Implementing a real-time countdown timer that decrements (e.g., from 02:05:50).
4.  Adding specific CSS in  to style the countdown with glassmorphism effects and animations.

The last successful action was the deployment of this animated countdown display, providing an engaging experience when no live stream is active. The work is now poised for a broader UI/UX overhaul, with the user's latest instruction being to replace the complete design with the modern layout from Bild 2.
