The AI engineer's work in this trajectory was highly iterative, driven by a continuous stream of user requests for new features, UI/UX enhancements, and numerous bug fixes. The journey began with foundational features like manual customer creation and last order display, quickly evolving into a full-scale refinement of the application. Key functional additions included multi-language support, a revamped user profile (with image, integrated logout, and compact language selection), a live shopping calendar with countdown, real-time admin sales statistics, a Top 3 buyers list for gamification, and chat pinning functionality. Significant effort was also dedicated to mobile optimization for various modals (e.g., calendar). A recurring challenge involved environment-specific issues, particularly  misconfigurations and WebSocket connection failures, requiring deep troubleshooting. The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic approach to debugging, especially for issues like non-updating chat/orders and customer creation failures, often identifying misinterpretations of UX behavior rather than core technical bugs. The trajectory concludes with a thorough investigation confirming the customer database is active, despite user claims.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was investigating a user report that the kundendatenbank immer noch nicht aktiv (customer database still not active). This involved a systematic debugging process across MongoDB, backend logs, and frontend API calls. The engineer confirmed that MongoDB was running, backend API calls were successful (200 OK), and direct database queries showed the  was active and contained  and other collections with 126 customer records. It was concluded that the user's perception of the database not being active was a misunderstanding, possibly related to the frontend display of customer data rather than the database's operational status. Prior to this, a critical WebSocket connection issue (preventing chat and order updates) was resolved by correcting the  in  to  for local development.
