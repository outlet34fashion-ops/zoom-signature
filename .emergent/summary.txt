The previous AI engineer successfully developed a Live Shopping App from scratch, adhering to an iterative, user-feedback-driven process. The core functionality, including a live streaming interface (initially a demo, then full Zoom integration), real-time chat, and product ordering, was implemented. Key architectural decisions involved using FastAPI for the backend, React with shadcn/ui for the frontend, and MongoDB for data persistence, all communicating via WebSockets for real-time updates.

The development trajectory shows a clear progression: initial build, adding an admin dashboard with order tracking, refining chat messages and UI elements, and finally, extensive integration of Zoom for live video. The Zoom integration itself went through several iterations, moving from a basic embedded link to a full SDK integration, then to a direct customer view without Zoom UI, and finally to addressing visual glitches. The engineer consistently used screenshots and a testing agent to validate functionality, ensuring a high-quality MVP. The latest interaction indicates a focus on resolving precise visual and functional issues with the embedded Zoom video display.

<product_requirements>
The primary requirement was to create a Live Shopping App similar to TikTok Shop or Instagram Live Shopping.
Initial features included:
-   **Live Streaming Interface:** Initially a demo video area, later evolved to full Zoom integration with host/viewer roles.
-   **Real-time Chat System:** WebSocket-based with emoji reactions and quick-action buttons.
-   **Product Selection & Ordering:** Size and price selection, quantity control, and a Bestellen (Order) button.
-   **Multi-language Support:** German/English toggle.
-   **Responsive Design:** Across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Subsequent enhancements and fixes:
-   **Price Adoption:** Selected prices should be used in orders, with manual price input.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** Counter for total and session orders, with a reset option.
-   **UI Refinements:** Smaller order display, ticker configurable via admin, specific chat message format (), compact Kunde angemeldet in the header, hide product selection for non-admins.
-   **Zoom Integration:** Integrate user's Zoom meeting link (ID , password ).
-   **Customer Stream Experience:** Direct video stream for customers without entering Zoom details, automatic stream start when admin is live, a professional studio view (portrait stream), no Zoom controls for customers.
-   **Bug Fixes:** Address issues where customers couldn't see the video, video was only loading, and currently addressing issues where a Zoom login screen appears, the video is cut off, or it's too large.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI:** Python backend framework for API and WebSocket handling.
-   **React:** JavaScript library for building the single-page application frontend.
-   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data persistence (chat, orders, Zoom sessions).
-   **WebSockets:** Real-time communication for chat and order updates.
-   **shadcn/ui:** Component library for a modern and stylish UI.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **Zoom Video SDK:** For embedding and managing live video streams.
-   **JWT:** Secure authentication for Zoom.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:


-   : This is the main FastAPI application. It defines API endpoints for chat, orders, and Zoom-related functionalities (e.g., generating JWT tokens, creating sessions). It also manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates. It was modified to handle order creation, admin counter updates, and Zoom integration.
-   : The central React component, acting as the main entry point and orchestrator for the frontend. It manages application state, handles routing between the main view and the admin dashboard, connects to WebSockets, renders UI components (chat, product display, order form, Zoom stream), and implements language switching. This file has seen extensive modifications for new features, UI adjustments, and embedding the Zoom video.
-   : Contains global and specific CSS rules. It was updated to implement custom styling, especially for the studio view, portrait video aspect ratio, and to hide unwanted Zoom UI elements within the embedded iframe.
-    (created): This dedicated React component encapsulates the Zoom Video SDK integration logic. It handles the lifecycle of joining/leaving Zoom sessions, managing host/viewer roles, and rendering the video stream. It was initially designed for SDK integration, then adapted to use a direct meeting link, and later modified to embed the iframe and apply CSS for UI hiding.
-    & : These files store environment variables.  is used by the backend, and  is used by the frontend. Zoom API credentials were added to the backend's  file for secure token generation.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the Zoom video display where a login screen appears for the customer.
-   Resolve the issue where the embedded Zoom video is cut off.
-   Adjust the embedded Zoom video size, as it is currently too large.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the Zoom video integration for the customer's view. The goal was to display only the video stream directly within the app, without any Zoom UI elements or login requirements. The engineer had successfully hidden most Zoom controls and embedded the video. However, upon recent testing or user feedback, three new problems were identified: a Zoom login screen is still appearing for the customer, the video stream is cut off, and its size is incorrect (too large). The AI engineer has just acknowledged these three specific issues and stated a plan to fix them. No code changes have been applied for these particular issues yet in the trajectory.

<optional_next_step>
Address the identified issues by implementing fixes to prevent the Zoom login screen, correct video cropping, and adjust the video size within the embedded player.
