The AI engineer successfully migrated the live shopping application's streaming functionality from a problematic LiveKit integration to a stable Daily.co solution, addressing a critical user requirement for low-latency streaming. This involved extensive backend and frontend modifications, including setting up new Daily.co API endpoints and refactoring  to replace LiveKit components. Subsequently, the engineer handled branding updates by replacing existing logos with new ones provided by the user. The final phase focused on refining the application's header: implementing dynamic login/logout buttons based on user authentication, and ultimately removing the header for unauthenticated users to create a cleaner landing page. Throughout the process, the engineer demonstrated adaptability, switching from AWS IVS to Daily.co based on user feedback, and meticulously debugging and refactoring code to meet specific UI/UX demands.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App is designed for live streaming, chat, and product ordering with a modern UI, including features like automatic Zebra label printing. Initial requests covered UI/UX improvements such as collapsible sections, refined input fields, sticky header/ticker, moving language selection, and a Termine (appointments) system with push notifications.

The **overriding current product requirement** during this trajectory was to deliver a **highly stable, low-latency live streaming solution (like Zoom)**, capable of supporting 30-100 viewers, replacing the unreliable LiveKit. Initially, Amazon AWS IVS was considered, but due to delays, the user opted for **Daily.co**.

Subsequent user requests involved:
1.  **Logo Replacement**: Update the application's branding with new logo images provided by the user.
2.  **Header Navigation and Authentication**: Integrate login (Kunden Login, Admin Login) and logout (Abmelden) buttons into the main header bar, making them conditionally visible based on user authentication status.
3.  **Header Visibility for Unauthenticated Users**: Remove the header navigation entirely from the main page for unauthenticated users, keeping it visible only after login.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed a series of high-priority tasks, leading to a stable and updated application:

1.  **Daily.co Live Streaming Integration**:
    *   The backend was updated by creating  to handle Daily.co API calls and modifying  to expose  and  endpoints. The  was added to . Backend functionality was confirmed 100% operational through automated testing.
    *   The frontend integrated Daily.co by installing  and . New React components (, ) were created.  was extensively refactored to remove all LiveKit code, integrate Daily.co states and functions (e.g., , ), and render the  component for live streaming.

2.  **Logo Replacement**:
    *   The application's branding was updated by downloading new logos (, ) into .
    *    was modified to reference these new logos across the UI, replacing the old  which was subsequently removed. Visual verification via screenshots confirmed the new logos were correctly displayed on the main page.

3.  **Dynamic Header and Authentication Buttons**:
    *   The header navigation in  was enhanced. New states (, ) and associated modals were implemented for user authentication.
    *   For authenticated users (specifically admins), the header now displays the new  logo, OUTLET34 Admin text, an Admin/Kunde toggle, and an Abmelden (Logout) button.
    *   For unauthenticated users, Kunden Login and Admin Login buttons were initially added to the header.

4.  **Header Visibility Adjustment**:
    *   Based on user feedback, the header navigation was subsequently removed from the main page for unauthenticated users, resulting in a cleaner landing page design. Page padding was adjusted accordingly. Login functionality remains accessible through dedicated buttons on the main page. Visual verification confirmed these changes were successfully implemented.

The application is now capable of stable, low-latency live streaming with Daily.co, features updated branding, and includes refined header navigation that dynamically adapts to user authentication status.
