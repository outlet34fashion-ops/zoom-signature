This trajectory captures the AI engineer's work on a Live Shopping App, responding to various user feature requests and bug reports. Initial focus was on fixing the  and implementing a new . Key developments include creating subcategory functionality, refining product input fields, and implementing horizontal category tabs. Significant effort was dedicated to improving the admin interface by adding buttons for viewing, editing, marking as out-of-stock, hiding, and deleting products. The mobile product catalog layout was optimized for two-column scrollable display. The Kürzlich angesehen (recently viewed) section was removed, and a Favoriten (favorites) button and modal were added. The final major task involved a critical customer data migration, cleaning the database, and importing new customer records from a CSV file. The process demonstrates iterative development, debugging, and careful handling of destructive operations.

<product_requirements>
The Live Shopping App is a platform for live shopping, chat, and product ordering, with a modern UI and automated Zebra label printing. It requires robust product and category management.
Implemented features from this trajectory include:
-  for hierarchical categories (main/subcategories) with drag-and-drop sorting.
- Material Properties modal for product specifics.
- Reordered product creation input fields (Price, Stock, Sizes, Colors, Material, Material Properties).
- Mobile optimization for the product catalog header and main product listings, showing two items side-by-side with horizontal scrolling.
- Horizontal, scrollable category tabs.
- Admin capabilities to view, edit, mark as ausverkauft (out of stock), ausblenden (hide), and löschen (delete) products.
- Removal of Kürzlich angesehen (recently viewed) section.
- Favoriten (favorites) button and modal, exclusively in the catalog header.
- Customer database cleanup and import of new customer data from a CSV, mapping specified columns.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement Desktop Split-Screen Layout to display Orders and Chat side-by-side.
- Provide the complete  and  files for Mac setup.
- Resolve frontend display issues for the extended customer profile fields (e.g., Mitglied seit, Status, trophy icon).
- Add images to articles for display in the product catalog.
- Address backend product API validation errors if they impact product display or sorting (though this was mostly a debug step).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a critical customer data migration. This involved:
1.  **Parsing a CSV file**: The engineer debugged encoding issues and successfully parsed a CSV file containing new customer data, identifying relevant columns ('Kundennummer', 'Firmenname', 'Vorname', 'Nachname', 'E-Mail 1').
2.  **Backend verification**: Tested existing backend APIs for customer management (backup, delete, import) to ensure a safe migration.
3.  **Executing the migration**: After user confirmation, the engineer performed the migration:
    *   Backed up existing customer data.
    *   Deleted all old customer records, including a specific admin PIN (1924).
    *   Imported 586 new customer records from the parsed CSV.
    *   Verified the final customer count in the database (728 customers).
4.  **Frontend verification**: Tested the frontend to confirm that new customer logins were successful and that the catalog was accessible with the updated data. The old admin PIN 1924 was confirmed to be non-functional, as expected.

The migration was successfully completed and verified.

<optional_next_step>
Based on the completed customer data migration, no immediate next step is explicitly required from the user.
